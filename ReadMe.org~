Lets consider you have two aws accounts
- Infrastructure Accout
  - Consist of all resources it does n't run any task,project but manages
  - All developer will push code in this account   
- Production Account
  - The task like build, deploy should be done in the Production there is no data(source code) link between two account

[GOAL]: To create a pipeline in Infrastructure Account and the build, deploy should be done in Production, Let make it simple
- Goal is create Pipeline in Infrastructure Account and Deploy in Production Account

- Requirements :
  - Infrastructure Account Id : << Account-A >> 918175365727
  - Production Account Id : << Account-B>> 548593215839
    
  - In Infrastructure Account(Account-A)
    - [Role] *CrossAccount-Role-of-A*
      - Trust relationship
